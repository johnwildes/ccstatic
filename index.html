				Chicago Chiefs opened in the fall of 2015.  It's been an amazing 6+ years of selling unique Navy Chief themed gear.  We've decided to close our shop.  It wasn't easy, there were a lot of factors involved in this decision.  We want to thank all of you who put your faith and support in us, purchasing gear, and sharing with your friends.  I have some supply of stuff left, if you've purchased in the past, and you have your order information, and need anything please reach out to <a href="mailto:customerservice@deckplatedev.com">customerservice@deckplatedev.com</a>.  We'll hold on to all records for the next few years if there's any promotions or if you would like to use our 129% Guarantee. 
				</p>
				<p> We may be back, we have some things in the works, if we can make them viable the store will relaunch.</p>
