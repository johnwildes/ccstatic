                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Like they say, all good things must come to an end.  For me the end of my Navy career is finally here. After 20 years 2 months and 3 days I am officially part of the Retired Reserve.  My retirement date was effective 01 OCT 22, and I found out about this on 15 SEP 22.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            That didn't leave a lot of time to plan a ceremony, which is why I'm hosting it this year on August 19th, 2023.  If you've arrived at this post, you've probably already filled out the RSVP form.  If not the details for the event are below, along with calendar links that allow you to put an event on your calendar for a reminder.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you're wondering who this Chief Wildes is, that's understandable.  Some of you know me very well, and some of you do not.  Chances are though you have one of my shirts, the blue ones with the big Chief anchor on the front.  I've enjoyed being a Chief in the Navy, and I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my life.  I hope to continue to support the Mess in any way that I can.  I'm also looking forward to spending more time with my family, and my friends.  I hope to see you all at the ceremony, and if not I hope to see you soon.</p>
